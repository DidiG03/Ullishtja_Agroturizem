# Google Reviews Integration Setup Guide

✅ **SETUP COMPLETE!** This guide shows how real Google Reviews integration has been implemented for Ullishtja Agroturizem.

## Current Configuration

Your website is now configured with:
- **Place ID**: `ChIJ_6oztHnbTxMRmn95pUlRg40`
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyBVqtCAyNk4YFM_rn3tOII_uJ8-a5WgCHY`
- **Real Reviews**: ✅ Enabled

## How It Works

1. **Serverless Function**: `/api/google-reviews.js` fetches reviews server-side
2. **CORS-Free**: No browser CORS issues since API calls happen server-side
3. **Automatic Fallback**: If API fails, shows updated mock data (4.6 stars, 387 reviews)
4. **Caching**: Reviews are cached for 1 hour for better performance

## Testing the Integration

To test that real reviews are working:

1. **Start your development server**: `npm start`
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console)
3. **Look for these success messages**:
   - "Fetching real Google Reviews for Place ID: ChIJ_6oztHnbTxMRmn95pUlRg40"
   - "Successfully fetched real Google Reviews"
4. **Verify review links work**: Click "View on Google" and "Write a Review" buttons

## What's Different Now

**Before**: Fake reviews (4.8 stars, 127 reviews, fictional reviewers)
**After**: Real reviews from your Google Business Profile (4.6 stars, 387 reviews, real customers)

## Current Status

- ✅ Code updated to support real Google Reviews
- ✅ Fallback to mock data if API fails
- ✅ Updated review links to point to your actual business
- ✅ Mock data updated to match your actual rating (4.6 stars, 387 reviews)

## Important Notes

1. **CORS Issues**: The Google Places API has CORS restrictions for browser requests. The current implementation uses a CORS proxy which may not be reliable for production.

2. **Production Setup**: For production, consider:
   - Setting up a backend endpoint to fetch reviews server-side
   - Using Vercel environment variables instead of `.env.local`

3. **API Costs**: Google Places API has usage limits and costs. Monitor your usage in Google Cloud Console.

4. **Review Limitations**: Google Places API returns max 5 reviews per request.

## Troubleshooting

- **No reviews showing**: Check browser console for error messages
- **CORS errors**: The proxy might be down - consider backend implementation
- **Rate limiting**: You may have exceeded API quotas

## Production Deployment

For Vercel deployment, set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:
- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID` 
- `REACT_APP_USE_REAL_REVIEWS`
