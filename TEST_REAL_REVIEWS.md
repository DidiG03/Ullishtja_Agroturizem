   ```

2. **Open your website** in the browser (usually http://localhost:3000)

3. **Open Developer Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

4. **Look for success messages** in the console:
   - ‚úÖ "Fetching real Google Reviews for Place ID: ChIJ_6oztHnbTxMRmn95pUlRg40"
   - ‚úÖ "Successfully fetched real Google Reviews"

5. **Check the Google Reviews section** on your website:

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Real Reviews Working
- Your actual star rating (4.6) displays
- Real customer names and review text

### ‚ùå FALLBACK: Using Mock Data

## Troubleshooting

- **No reviews showing**: Check console for error messages
